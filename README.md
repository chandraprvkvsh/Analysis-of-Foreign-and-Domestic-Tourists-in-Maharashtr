# Analysis-of-Foreign-and-Domestic-Tourists-in-Maharashtra

Firstly, Collected some tourism data for the State of Maharashtra.
Added some synthetic data to original data to prepare the final dataset.
Then made some useful inferences by various approaches.
Built a Neural-Network based recommendation system which would recommend places similar to a given place in a given district.

NOTE : The goal here was to focus on the procedure of making inferences from such a dataset, Because not all the data here is real. Some of it is synthetic.
